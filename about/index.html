<h4>Our Vision</h4>
<p>
    Mentoring Adults and Youth in America Foundation, Inc. (M.A.Y.A. Foundation, Inc.) is a non-profit organization providing mentoring programs to young adults and youth in the Greater Richmond, Virginia/ Petersburg, Viginia area and surrounding counties.The program will form partnerships with local school districts and other adult programs that will promote pro-social friendships, strong interpersonal skills, and reassert a sense of hope in the future. Only through personal relationships can a sense of individual responsibility be reestabished that will give youth the commitment to follow through on path to adulthood with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Our goal is to identify youth who are going to have a turbulent transition to adulthood and offer a positive support system to avoid the pitfalls that can derail their lives.
